## Installation

If you have a recent version of Python 3, you should be able to
do `pip install deebot-client` to get the most recently released version of
this.

## Usage

To get started, you'll need to have already set up an EcoVacs account
using your smartphone.

You are welcome to try using this as a python library for other efforts.
A simple usage might go something like this:

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio
import logging
import time

from deebot_client.api_client import ApiClient
from deebot_client.authentication import Authenticator
from deebot_client.commands import *
from deebot_client.commands.clean import CleanAction
from deebot_client.events import BatteryEvent
from deebot_client.models import Configuration
from deebot_client.mqtt_client import MqttClient, MqttConfiguration
from deebot_client.util import md5
from deebot_client.vacuum_bot import VacuumBot

device_id = md5(str(time.time()))
account_id = "your email or phonenumber (cn)"
password_hash = md5("yourPassword")
continent = "eu"
country = "de"


async def main():
  async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    config = Configuration(session,
                           device_id=device_id, country=country, continent=continent,
                           )

    authenticator = Authenticator(config, account_id, password_hash)
    api_client = ApiClient(authenticator)

    devices_ = await api_client.get_devices()

    bot = VacuumBot(devices_[0], authenticator)

    mqtt_config = MqttConfiguration(config=config)
    mqtt = MqttClient(mqtt_config, authenticator)
    await bot.initialize(mqtt)

    async def on_battery(event: BatteryEvent):
      # Do stuff on battery event
      if event.value == 100:
        # Battery full
        pass

    # Subscribe for events (more events available)
    bot.events.subscribe(BatteryEvent, on_battery)

    # Execute commands
    await bot.execute_command(Clean(CleanAction.START))
    await asyncio.sleep(900)  # Wait for...
    await bot.execute_command(Charge())


if __name__ == '__main__':
  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
  loop.create_task(main())
  loop.run_forever()
```
